# -Rain-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
I developed a machine learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using the Rain in Australia dataset. This project applies both Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers to forecast rainfall based on weather attributes like humidity, temperature, wind direction, and pressure.
🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
📈 Models: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
🔍 Project Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed a real-world dataset with categorical encoding and feature scaling

Performed EDA and visualized relationships between weather variables

Trained and compared Decision Tree and Random Forest models using R² score

Plotted predictions and visualized decision tree structure from the forest

Deployed prediction on new unseen weather data with probability insights
